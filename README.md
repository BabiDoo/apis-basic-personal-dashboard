# API Personal Dashboard

This repository contains the **final project (Project 4)** from the **"Learn to Work with APIs" Specialization** on Coursera.  
The project is a **Personal Dashboard** built with JavaScript and APIs, allowing the user to display real-time data such as cryptocurrency prices, weather, background images, and current time.

## ðŸ“š About the Specialization
Although this repository includes only the final project, it is part of a broader course where I learned to:
- Make HTTP requests to external APIs.
- Fetch, display, and process JSON data.
- Build dynamic web pages with asynchronous JavaScript.
- Use **promises** and **async/await** for cleaner asynchronous code.
- Integrate multiple APIs into a single responsive application.

The specialization included multiple API-based projects, and this **dashboard** is the culmination of all the skills learned.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
The **API Personal Dashboard** integrates several APIs to display:
- **Cryptocurrency Data** (Dogecoin) using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation).
- **Random Nature Backgrounds** using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).
- **Local Weather** using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- **Current Local Time** with automatic updates.

### ðŸ”¹ Features
- Live cryptocurrency price tracking.
- Daily random background image.
- Real-time local weather information.
- Clock that updates every minute.
- Error handling with fallback data.
